# odin-landing-page
Update:
I've made an index.html file which I've coded accordingly to the design.
I've made an style.css file which I've coded accordingly to the design with my knowledge.


I'll create an entire web page from a design provided by TOP.
Design provided comes in form of 2 images (1 of complete website and 1 of details about styling).
From that I need to create a website from scratch using what I've learned.
If I'll get stuck, I'll search the internet.
